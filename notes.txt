> Hmm... QWERTY, AZERTY... QWERTZ... These magic incantations seem to carry meaning... The key to the spirit board perhaps? A board-key? No.... perhaps a key-board... Which of these seem most familiar?

> Bleagh.... Hmm...
> Ack! My bloodsworn have failed to wake me from my meditations! If I don't complete tonight's ritual, our Dark Lord will turn his malevolent gaze upon us.
> But... there is still time... 2 minutes to midnight... I must make haste.

*blink transition*

> By divine fortune, tonight's spell is foolsplay - even my bloodsworn could complete it.

> I must hold the astral runes in my minds eye and *join the left and right halves of runes*. My *pressing each key repeatedly*, I should be able to progress through the spell.

>> 

> Yes! that's it!

alarm clock clatters down in corner

> I must keep an eye on the time and complete the rest - only minutes remain.

*game starts*

>> FIE - DOOM BEFALLS OUR SECT. OUR FATES ARE IN HIS GRIEVOUS HANDS NOW.
>> I must make a new attempt.
>>> Click to Restart.

>Ah, respite. Until tomorrow night then, my Dark Lord.

*blink transition*

> The antepenultimate spell awaits. The incantations are longer tonight.
> What's more, my bloodsworn seem to have absconded and so I must complete our Dark Lord's task alone.
> Damn these hellsborn candles that keep blowing out - I must *click* this reigniter and keep the darkness hungry.

*lighter tutorial*

> Let it be so... Ah, but midnight draws closer once again...

*game and clock starts*

> Ahh,... I can feel His satisfaction.

*blink*

> Our Lord's return will usher in an age of divine music! All will hear the Bells of Recrudescence, and shed inky tears as alms to the Abyss.
> Tonight, these preliminary bells must ring. When Our Lord indicates, we must touch the number of each bell exactly once, in order to satiate His whims. Hark!

*bell ringing tutorial*

> Just so. Take care my dark pilgrim, for unring bells anger Our Lord, who will eat time itself until He is appeased.

*game*

> Another triumpant communion.

*blink*

> Our final spell awaits.
> Our Dark lord is now caressing the veil betwixt astral planes, and is close enough that the miracle of His baleful heart is audible.
> When I hear His heartbeat, I must match it's rhythm to strengthen our bond - press the Space key in time to the beat, else suffer his scrutiny.

*heartbeat tut*

> All is prepared - Lord, give me the strength of conviction to conclude Your final rites...
> Begin.
*game*

> What glorious benediction! The hour of awakening is nigh! Let all that look upon his material flesh be blinded by his calamitous radiance!

*kitten summoning sequence, lights go pink, smoke?*

> ...Um
> My Lord, you look very.... kawaii today... Is this you.... usual form?
*kitten angry, growls*

> Oh no, totally fine! I just had this whole vibe going.... you know what, it's fine. We can roll with it.
> So... can I offer you some breakfast? We have maple pancakes or if you prefer-

*evil glint*
*pounces*
